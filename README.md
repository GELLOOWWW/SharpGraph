# SharpGraph

![SharpGraph](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b283bb-6aee-4857-8223-2c316f1d1f6d)

SharpGraph is a Graphing Calculator inspired by Desmos and the TI-84 Calculator, fully written in C#, using no other libraries or frameworks outside the core .NET framework itself. This app is capable of graphing most, if not all implicit functions (f(x,y) = 0) in a Cartesian Coordinate Plane. 

Additionally, it also comes with a Unit Converter (as per requirement) and an Arithmetical Calculator (additional feature).
